# Glossary Block

Adds a definition list block (`<dl>` element). The definition element is really useful!

Based on [wp-block-description-list](https://github.com/lassemt/wp-block-description-list), but with updated dependencies and a simpler implementation.

The use of `compose` in the original is pretty cool, though!

Comes with a mostly blank tailwindcss config and some postcss plugin dev dependencies. But, it's free of any production modules.
