# WP Block Glossary

Adds a description list (`<dl>` element) to Gutenberg.

This block doesn't come with any styles except for a reset on the user default `margin-default-start` so I didn't lose my mind. I figure if you want a `dl/dt/dd` block you probably have your own plans.

## Colophon

Based on [wp-block-description-list](https://github.com/lassemt/wp-block-description-list), but with updated dependencies and a simpler implementation.
